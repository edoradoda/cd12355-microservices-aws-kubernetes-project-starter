# Desplegar una aplicaci√≥n con su base de datos en Kubernetes (AWS EKS) 

## Getting Started
fork and clone https://github.com/edoradoda/cd12355-microservices-aws-kubernetes-project-starter

## ** Coworking app**

Deploy an application called coworking with its database in Kubernetes on Amazon Web Service AWS.

The Coworking aplication Service is a set of APIs that enables users to request one-time tokens and administrators to authorize access to a coworking space. This service follows a microservice pattern and the APIs are split into distinct services that can be deployed and managed independently of one another.

## **Introduction**

This project contains the step-by-step instructions for deploying an application and its database on Kubernetes for the Amazon AWS cloud.

## **Dependencies**
Tools that must be installed in the console:

aws cli: to access the AWS cloud
eksctl: used to create EKS clusters
kubectl : to interact with the cluster in EKS
command to create a cluster if you don't have one:
**`eksctl create cluster --name <MY-CLUSTER> --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name starter-nodes --node-type t3.small --nodes 1 --nodes -min 1 --nodes-max 2`**
